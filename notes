Not including addmin routes at the present.
DB admin is responsible for adding, editing users and info
Admin will post to one api route then if else will handle which task it is doing
- adding user
- deleting user
- editing user info

Need to figure out how to auth only the admin user to admin routes with jwt tokens

@app.route("/admin", methods=["GET"])
def adminPage():
    return render_template('admin.html')

    Invalid content-type. Must be application/json.; Missing 'jwt' query paramater)"}

needs redis to be running

Fix when editing a user having to specify every gear value. Should be able to only edit certain gear pieces.
